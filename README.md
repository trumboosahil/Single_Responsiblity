# Single Responsiblity

## Tight Coupling
Uncle bob said each software module has one reason to change

Classes should do task in abstract way

What is reposbilibility

1. Persistance
2. Logging  
4. Exception
5. Buisness logic

Then these can be divide further modules. Responsiblities change at different time and different level that have their own axis of change. Like HR may ask some changes, CFO want some changes so changes should be seperated. This is called seperation concern 

Class elements that belong togther should be togther and if something is not related that it should be seperate

# Single responsiblitie and testability
## Test Become
- Longer
- More Complex
- Brittle 




When two are more details are coupled togther
